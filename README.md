# IRIs-Flower-Classification
# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Introduction
This project is a part of my internship at codeSoft, where I worked on Iris Flower Classification. It focuses on developing a machine learning model for classifying Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which can be distinguished based on their measurements. The objective is to train a model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species using the provided dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset). It contains measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. The dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks due to its simplicity and relevance.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
- **Approach**: Utilize machine learning classification algorithms to train a model based on the provided dataset.
- **Tools and Libraries**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Acquisition**: Obtained the Iris flower dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored the dataset to understand the distribution of features and relationships between different species.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Extracted relevant features from the dataset, if necessary.
5. **Model Building**: Utilized classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc., to build and train the predictive model.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuned the parameters of the chosen model to optimize its performance.
8. **Final Model Selection**: Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Results
The trained model achieved satisfactory performance in classifying Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. Detailed evaluation metrics and results are documented in the project's code and reports.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable experience in classification techniques using machine learning algorithms. The developed model can accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning in botanical research and floriculture.
